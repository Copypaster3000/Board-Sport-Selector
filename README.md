The purpose of this program is to tell me which sport is best for today based on the conditions. It compares surfing, kiteboarding, snowboarding, and skating conditions at places near Portland, OR, where I live. Then it tells me which has the best conditions for today. It uses APIs to get weather reports and the conditions of each sport and creates scores for how good the conditions are, then compares them.
