# Optimal Sport Condition Finder

## Introduction
Welcome to the Optimal Sport Condition Finder - your personal advisor for picking the best sport to enjoy today based on live weather conditions! Living near the dynamic landscape of Portland, OR, we're blessed with a range of sports to choose from. Whether you're looking to catch waves, carve snow, or roll down the skatepark, this Python program is here to ensure you make the best choice without the guesswork.

## How It Works
This program harnesses the power of various weather APIs to fetch real-time conditions for surfing, kiteboarding, snowboarding, and skating spots around Portland. It then analyses this data to create condition scores for each sport. By comparing these scores, the program delivers a recommendation for which sport boasts the best conditions on any given day.

Here's what the program does step-by-step:
1. Gathers current weather conditions using reliable APIs.
2. Evaluates the suitability of conditions (wind, waves, snow, etc.) for each sport.
3. Calculates scores representing the quality of conditions for each sport.
4. Compares the scores and suggests the sport with the optimal conditions for today.
